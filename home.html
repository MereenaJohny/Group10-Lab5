            How fun is it to start the summer off with new sandals! The main focus should be on quality, style, and comfort. 
            It’s important to know what kind of leather and materials are used and the type, materiality, and purpose of the 
            sole. In Dolita’s designer footwear collections, you’ll find lots of minimalism, eclecticism, romance, and subtle 
            punk details. In our sandal collections, you’ll find colors that seem to be sun-faded, studs, snakeskin prints, 
            sporty soles, extremely soft leather… These sandals and slippers are an absolute must to slip in your travel bag 
            next to your bathing suit! So pay attention not only to the comfort of footwear but also to its practicality and 
            materiality. Choose sandals with leather inside or sporty ones with technical mesh. Remember that today’s fashion 
            is erasing the boundaries which used to tell us that you absolutely cannot go to dinner on vacation wearing sneakers, 
            or that beach slippers are only suitable for walking to the beach or pool.
